of Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fast during Ramadan.
(Bukhari, Muslim).

and if anyone draws the length of a cubit near Me, I shall draw the length
of a fathom near him. If anyone comes to Me walking I shall come to him

of forgiveness.

and thus enters it.

of us knew him. He walked and sat down by the Prophet (peace be upon him).
Resting his knees against his and placing the palm of his hands on his
thigh, he said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam. The Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him) said: Islam is to testify that there is no god but
Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to
pay the zakat (NOTE 4) ,
to fast in Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House (NOTE
5) if you are able to do so. He said: You
have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that
he had spoken right. He said: Then tell me about iman (NOTE
6) . The Prophet (may the blessings and peace
of Allah be upon him ) said: It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His
books, His messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny,
both the good and evil thereof. He said: You have spoken rightly. He said:
Then tell me about ihsan (NOTE 7) ,
The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ) said: It
is to worship Allah as though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him
not yet truly He sees you. He said then tell me about the Hour (NOTE
8) , The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
The one questioned about it knows no better than the questioner. He said:
Tell me about its signs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The slave-girl
will give birth to her mistress (NOTE 9) and
that you will see the barefooted naked, destitute herdsmen competing in
constructing lofty buildings. Then he took himself off and I stayed for
a time. Then the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon)
said: O Umar, do you know who the questioner was? I said: Allah and hid
Messenger know best. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It was Gabriel,
who came to you to teach you your religion.

210. That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain
and between the two if them are doubtful matters about which not many people
know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his
religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into
that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around the sanctuary,
all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah's
sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh
which, if diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart. 
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

deed and it will wipe it out, and behave well towards people. 
(Tirmidhi).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).
215. Purity is half of faith. Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fills
the scales, and Subhana 'llah [How far is Allah from every imperfection]
and Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fill that which is between heaven
and earth. Prayer is light; charity is a proof; patience is illumination;
and the Quran is an argument for or against you. Everyone starts his day
and is a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).
216. I have been ordered to fight (NOTE
10) against people until they testify that
there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and
until he perform the prayers and pay the zakat, and if they do so, they
will have gained protection from me for their lives (NOTE
11) and property, unless [they do acts that
are punishable] in accordance with Islam, and their reckoning will be with
Allah the Almighty. 
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).
217. Verily Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. Thus, if
you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one
of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.

(Ibn Majah and Daraqutni).

was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salam
who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of

lifted his hand and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to
stoning. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pronounced
judgement about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. Umar said:

earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would
bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it (NOTE

rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it
for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of
the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could
neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then the land did not
give any benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends
Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has

Al-Jarud who was by my side, "It means from his throat to his pubic
area," or said, "from the top of the chest." The Prophet
(peace be upon him) further said, "He then took out my heart. Then
a gold tray full of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and
was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then
a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey,
was brought to me." (on this Al-Jarud asked, "Was it the Buraq,
O Abu Hamza?" I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet
(peace be upon him) said, "The animal's step (was so wide that it)
reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal's sight. I was
carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest
heaven. When he asked for the gate to be opened it was asked, 'Who is it?'
Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel
replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has Muhammad been called?' Gabriel
replied in affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven,
I saw Adam there. 
Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.'
So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are
welcomed, o pious son and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me
till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened.
It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who
is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he
been called?' Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He
is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and
when I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yaya (i.e. John) and Isa
(i.e. Jesus), who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), 'These
are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.' So I greeted them and both
of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, o pious
brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third
heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?'
Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel
replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied
in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven,
there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Joseph; pay him your
greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,
'You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended
with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was
asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying
you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?'
Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed.
What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over
the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Idris;
pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings
to me and said, 'You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.'
Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate
to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel' It
was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was
asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it
was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was
opened, and when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e.
Aron) Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Aron; pay him your greetings.' So
I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed,
o pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the
sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is
it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?'
Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel
replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent
visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went (over the sixth heaven),
there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Moses; pay him your greetings.'
So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are
welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses)
he wept. Someone asked, 'What makes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because
after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will
enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then Gabriel ascended
with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was
asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying
you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?'
Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He is welcomed. What
an excellent visit his is!' So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there
I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your father; pay him your
greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,
'You are welcomed, o pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend
to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the farthest limit). Behold!
Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its
leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This is the
Lote Tree of the farthest limit.' Behold! There ran four rivers, two were
hidden and two were visible. I asked, 'What are these two kinds of rivers,
O Gabriel?' He replied, 'As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers
in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then
Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e.the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container
full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought
to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, 'This is the Islamic religion
which you and your followers are following.' Then the prayers were enjoined
on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses
who asked (me), 'What have you been ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have
been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.' Moses said, 'Your followers
cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before
you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israil (in vain). Go back
to your Lord and ask for reducing your followers' burden.' So I went back,
and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he
repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah
and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the
same, I went back and Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a
day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went
back to Allah was ordered to observe five prayers a day. When I came back
to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been
ordered to observe five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot
bear five prayers a day,(NOTE 36)
and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I
have tried my level best with Bani Israil, so go back to your Lord and
ask for reducing your followers' burden.' I said, 'I have requested so
much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender
to Allah's order.' When I left, I head a voice saying, 'I have passed My
Order and have reduced the burden of My Worshippers.'"

performed (this refers to Taraweeh Salaat) during the nights of Ramadhan,
Allah Ta'ala records one and a half thousand good deeds for every Sajdah
(of the Salaat). And, for the fasting person, Allah Ta'ala creates in Jannat
a mansion of red Ya'koot (a precious stone in Jannat). This mansion will
have seven thousand entrances. (So huge will these entrances be that in
each entrance will be located) a palace of gold adorned with red Ya'koot.
When the Muslims fast the first day if Ramadhan, Allah Ta'ala forgives
all his sins committed from the first of the previous Ramadhan. Daily (i.e.
during Ramadhan) from the time of Fajr Salat until sunset, seventy thousand
Malaaikah supplicate for his forgiveness. In return for every Sajdah which
he (the fasting person) makes, of any Salat, whether during the day or
night, he will obtain (such a wonderful) tree (so huge) that a horseman
will take five hundred years to pass under its shade."

shower His pleasure on the reciter. Allah will then become pleased with
him. The reciter will then be asked to recite the Qur'an, thereby attaining
higher ranks of elevation. In reward for each aayat a virtue will accrue
to him."
